## About the problem
- **Problem Number** : 1
- **Problem Name** : Two Sum
- **Problem difficulty** : Easy (51.25%)
- **Category** : Algorithms

In this problem we have integer array and target, solution must return indices of the two numbers in array such they add up to _target_ 
given examples are 

>Example 1:
>
>Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
>Output: [0,1]
>Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
>Example 2:
>
>Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
>Output: [1,2]
>Example 3:
>
>Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
>Output: [0,1]
